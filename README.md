# Why I´m doing this Project?
The growing concern for sustainability and environmental responsibility has pushed the food industry to explore new ways of producing and packaging food products. In this context, Ecotrophelia has become an important platform for young entrepreneurs to showcase their innovative ideas for sustainable food products. Our team is proud to present our project for the Ecotrophelia 2023 competition - an eco-friendly edible spoon made using 3D printing technology and Portuguese ingredients.

To create the perfect recipe for our edible spoon, we conducted a thorough analysis of various data points related to the ingredients and some characteristics of the final product. To make sense of the dataset, we employed clustering analysis, a widely used technique in data analysis that groups similar items together. The results of our analysis helped us identify the ideal combination of ingredients to create a delicious, healthy, and sustainable spoon that will not only reduce waste but also add a unique and flavorful experience to the food consumption process.

# What is Ecotrophelia?

Ecotrophelia is a European competition for students who develop innovative, sustainable, and eco-friendly food products. It was first launched in France in 2000 and has since expanded to other countries in Europe. The competition challenges students to create new food products that are environmentally sustainable, healthy, and commercially viable. It aims to encourage young people to be more aware of the environmental impact of food production and to promote entrepreneurship in the food industry. The competition provides a platform for students to showcase their innovative ideas and receive recognition for their work.

# Spoon-Eat

Spoon-eat it´s a product develop by a group of friends. This are cookies shaped like a spoon and they fit in the cookie, utensils and snacks categories. Their main ingredients are chickpea flour, rice flour, chestnut flour and cinnamon. They have the appearance of small brown colored spoons, due to the flours and spices used. These ingredients are what gives Spoon-eat their flavour and texture. Spoon-eat are an innovative source of fiber and it can be used in various ways, with whatever you want: jams, yogurt, ice cream, coffee, tea, etc. - the possibilities are endless. They’re made using 3D printers and mainly Portuguese raw materials, some being the byproduct of other industries.

# The DataSet
During the development process of Spoon-Eat, our team took a data-driven approach to create the perfect eco-friendly edible spoon made with Portuguese ingredients using 3D printing technology. We collected data on the quantities of each ingredient used in each recipe, as well as important characteristics of the final product such as texture of the raw dough, 3D printing performance, taste, and crispiness. This data was then analyzed through clustering analysis to find the optimal recipe for our Spoon-Eat product. Through this approach, we were able to create a high-quality and sustainable product that meets the needs of modern consumers while also reducing the environmental impact of disposable cutlery.

# Results
In order to analyze the data collected during the development process of Spoon-Eat, it was used the elbow method and dendrogram to identify three clusters. Then, we performed k-means and hierarchical clustering to obtain more detailed results.

The clustering analysis helped us to categorize the recipes into three different groups based on their quality, then each cluster were analysed in more detail. This analysi allows us to identified a cluster with low-quality recipes, a cluster with intermediate-quality recipes, and a cluster with high-quality recipes. Above you can some some of the high-quality results cluster.

1. Priting Performance:

This cluster appears to have a good priting performance, where 75% off the recipes had a good priting performance, and only 25% had a bad performance. Just one recipe had a bad priting performance.

2. Taste

Every recipe of this cluster had a good taste.

3. Crispiness

Overall this cluster appears to be crunchy performance, where 75% off the recipes were crunchy. Just one recipe wasn´t crunchy.

# Conclusions
The results of this analysis provided us with valuable insights that were used to optimize our recipe and improve its overall quality. This approach also helped us to identify the most important ingredients and quantities to use in the recipe, as well as the optimal printing conditions to achieve the desired texture and crispiness. Overall, the clustering analysis was an essential tool in the development of Spoon-Eat, allowing us to create an eco-friendly, tasty, and innovative product that we are proud to present in the Ecotrophelia 2023 competition.
